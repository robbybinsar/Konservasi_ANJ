## Beta Diversity

Beta diversity is a comparison of diversity between ecosystems, usually measured as the amount of species change between the ecosystem, while Abundance is the statistical comparison between individual and the whole community in the particular area.

`beta&abundance_diversity_measures.R` is an R script that consists of several ecological analysis for beta diversity measures that consist of:

* Similarity analysis
  + Brainerd-Robinson quantitative index (similarity between assemblages)
  + Jaccard qualitative index (similarity between assemblages)
  + Binomial co-occurrence (similarity between types)
  
*Data Sample*

To get more understanding on how the function works please refer to one of the example for beta diversity measures in markdown file `beta-and-abundance_diversity_measures.md`.

## Abundance Model

Computes comparison between Ranks and abundance plot

*Data Sample*

To get more understanding on how the function works please refer to one of the example for beta diversity measures in markdown file `beta-and-abundance_diversity_measures.md`.
